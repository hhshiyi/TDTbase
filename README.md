## Overview

This package is a bundling of utility libraries developed for trans-dimensional
tree inversions. A brief description follows:

* hnk - the library for computing combinations of tree arrangements
* log - generic logging library
* oset - ordered set library
* tracking - time tracking library
* wavelet - routines for various wavelet bases for forward and inverse transforms
* sphericalwavelet - old routines for spherical wavelets on sphere surfaces
* wavetree - routines for trans-dimensional trees using a wavelet parameterisation
